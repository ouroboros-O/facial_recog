## Siamese Neural Networks:

First, we needed to remove stopwords and implement stemming on our dataset. For this purpose, we used *nltk* in Python. 
The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language.
To implement specific functions like *porterstemmer()* and use the library of *stop words* we might get in the dataset or in a query, we imported these specific libraries from the suite nltk.


## Convolutional Architecture:



## Download and Running:

To run the project, do the following:

Use git to clone this repository into your computer.

Download the trained model from this google drive link and place it into the following directories:
face\facial_recog\legacy
facial_recog\finalapp

Run the py script in the finalapp folder.

If you wish to see the and or execute the scripts I used to compile the AI model you can see them in the legacy folder.

## Conclusion

Overall it was an intense but extremely fun. Attempting to get the GPU to work with tensorflow so that the AI Model could be built in a timely fashion took an inordinate amount of time but overall I am very pleased with the results. We have good accuracy and a method that works. It's quite fascinating to see it working in real time.
